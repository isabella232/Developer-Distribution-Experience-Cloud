# Adobe Developer Distribution

A self-service submission portal for developers to publish listings that extend Adobe products on the Adobe marketplaces.​

## Overview

[Adobe Developer Distribution](/distribute/home) is a new surface for developers to submit and manage their listings. The Developer Distribution surface offers a powerful and flexible approach to allow developers to create listings more rapidly and receive approval with minimal Adobe reviewer turnaround time. This document focuses on listing submission for Experience Cloud App Builder applications and software integrations although Creative Cloud plugin listings can also be created and managed in Developer Distribution.

## App Builder applicatons versus software integrations.

App Builder provides a unified third-party extensibility framework for integrating and creating custom experiences to extend Adobe solutions. App Builder appliations can be submitted in Developer Distribution to be discovered, acquired, and deployed by enterprise users from Adobe Exchange. App builder listings consist of metadata and a version of the extension that can be acquired by customers. See the submission tab for App Builder application specific workflows.

Software integrations are third party integrations that extend one or more Experience Cloud products. Customers discover the listings on Adobe Exchange and acquire the integration directly from the partner. Software integration listings consist of metadata only, and don’t have versions of software that can be acquired from Adobe Exchange. See the Submissions tab for software integration specific workflows.

## Access the Developer Distribution Portal

Upon registration in the Technology Partner Portal (TPP) partners receive an org that gets associated with their login credentials.  After being approved into the TPP, developers should have no problems logging into Developer Distribution or Developer Console with the org name appearing in the upper right “org picker”. TPP members who get an error should contact [TPP Support](https://adobeexchangeec.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new/).
